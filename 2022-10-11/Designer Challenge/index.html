          Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could
          improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start
          designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
          stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge,
          something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many
          designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I
          really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
          something nice and did not solve any problem.

        <h2>Start with asking why</h2>
        <p>
          You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
          effective ways of achieving goals.
        </p>

        <h2>Your ideas will have more value</h2>
        <p>
          By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will
          be fresher and more valuable.

        <h2>Design solutions with love</h2>
        <p>
          Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
          frustration of the users and resolve to end it.
        </p>

        <h2>Share and show your work</h2>
        <p>
          As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished
          or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback and learn
          from it.

        The challenge lasts 30 days. On each of those days you will have to
        create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the
        result to the community.

        <h2>Find your problem</h2>
        <p>
          It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you,
          like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something.
          Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to
          your surroundings.

        <p>
          It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these
          problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook and
          start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

          How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
          features and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget to
          always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
